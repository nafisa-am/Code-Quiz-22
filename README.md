# Code-Quiz-22

# Applications Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Brief Description

In this project I was tasked with building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.
This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

# User Guide

When you load the page click on the 'start quiz' button. This will then direct you to the questions phase and simultaneously start the countdown on the timer. When you answer a question correctly you will be directed to the next question if you answer incorrectly then 10 seconds is deducted from your time. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the the game is over. Once the game is over you are able to input your initials and save your score.
